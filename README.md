This is a simple static website for recording encountered mushrooms. It's like bird watching, but you watch mushrooms instead (they have less tendency to fly away when you get closer).

The website is using a single JSON file as a database and is powered by a bit of JavaScript code.
Nothing fancy but it does the trick.
